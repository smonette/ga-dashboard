# GA Dashboard

===========

## Description
Our project provides GA students and staff with an overview of the happening around 501 Folsom. 

A guest user is able to see neighborhood food specials, Bart departure times, and the shoutouts wall. As a guest, the experiece is only informational.

By creating an account a user is able to see contact information for other students, add shoutouts to the wall, and check the vacancy of our bathrooms.
